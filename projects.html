        How It Works: To move the camera, move your mouse. To zoom in and out, use your scroll wheel.

        What I learned: From making this model, I've learned how to use the basic
        functions of Unity. This includes creating UI, using different lighting settings, 
        exploring using different materials, and more. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Challenges: The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out the lighting for the Sun.
        I struggled figuring this out and even now it's not perfect. As far as I know, in Unity
        there isn't a light setting to set a dynamic object as a light source. What I ended up doing for 
        the sun is using an emissive material. This way the emission is only on the Sun, not other
        objects. 
        As for the light on other objects, I used the directional light setting. I used this since I couldn't 
        use the emission from the Sun on dynamic objects.
